* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger, Eat-Da-Burger! will display the burger's name in the 'Check for your Burger' list.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Place Order` button.

* When the user check out, the system will ask for user's name initial, and then burger will move to the left side of the page.
